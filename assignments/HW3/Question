Problem#1
Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion i.e.dynamical model for the three-link RRR elbow manipulator shown in the below figure.
Consider the links to be massless, that is, consider point masses at the end of each link similar to what we had in the lecture for the two-link arm.
For this problem, you need to explore the use of symbolic software, such as Maple, Mathematica, MATLAB, or any other software that
you feel comfortable with.

Problem#2
For the 2-link arm shown below, let 𝑙1,𝑙2 be the distances of the centers of mass of the two links from the respective joint axes and
𝑎1,𝑎2 be the length of the two links. Also let 𝑚1 , 𝑚2 be the masses of the two links. Finally, let 𝐼1,𝐼2 be the moments of 
inertia relative to the centers of mass of the two links, respectively. Derive the dynamical model of the robot using Lagrange’s equation
and finally write a MATLAB code that calculates the joint torques for any given configuration/state of the robot.
Consider 𝑙𝑖=𝑎𝑖2 for simplicity. It is very important that you show your work with all details!

In Problem 2, we do not have point masses but the masses of the links are taken into account with the center of masses shown in the 
figure below. Therefore, you need to take into consideration both the translational and rotational kinetic energies.
The latter includes the mass moment of inertia of the link around its center of mass (𝐼𝑖). 
Therefore, 𝐾𝑖=𝐾𝑖,𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠+𝐾𝑖,𝑟𝑜𝑡=12𝑚𝑖𝑣𝑖2+12𝐼𝑖𝑞̇𝑖2. While this topic is discussed in your reading assignment,
Chapter 6, another useful example of a similar robot is also attached as reference.
